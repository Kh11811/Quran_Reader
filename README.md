Hey</br>
This project is about getting started with API's.</br>
Here we used an API to get Qran surahs, ayahs and even hear it by the reciter Mishary Al Afasy.</br>
You will find 2 codes : the first is for local machines using vscode and the second is for users of Google Colab.</br>
You will be guided to use both of them.</br>
1-vscode</br>
You will need some libraries to install :</br>
open cmd as administrator > <code>pip install requests os pygame time arabic_reshaper python-bidi </code></br>
When running the program you will be able to choose the number of surahs</br>
Than you have the choice </br>
1- Read Surah</br>
2- Read ayah</br>
3- hear ayah</br>
Accordingly , run the program and enjoy </br>
2-Google Colab</br>
In colab just paste the program and choose the function to run.</br>
It's a bit different from vscode version and you don't have the choice maker , instead you run the function you want.</br>
