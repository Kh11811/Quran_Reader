Hey
This project is about getting started with API's.
Here we used an API to get Qran surahs, ayahs and even hear it by the reciter Mishary Al Afasy.
You will find 2 codes : the first is for local machines using vscode and the second is for users of Google Colab.
You will be guided to use both of them.
1-vscode
You will need some libraries to install :
open cmd as administrator > <code>
pip install requests os pygame time arabic_reshaper python-bidi </code>
